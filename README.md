# Adult Census Prediction System üòÑ

## Description
<b>
The prominent inequality of wealth and income is a huge concern, especially in the United States.
The likelihood of diminishing poverty is one valid reason to reduce the world's surging level of economic inequality.
The principle of universal moral equality ensures sustainable development and improves the economic stability of a nation.
This study aims to show the usage of machine learning and data mining techniques in providing a solution to the income equality problem.
This project is done as an internship under "iNeuron Intelligence Pvt Ltd."

## Objectives
The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not.

This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the 

>50K group or <=50K group.<br><br>

## Life Cycle of Machine Learning Project
